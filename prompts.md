# Prompts Used with LLM

## Basic Questions
1. How many games did this team play?
2. Who scored the most goals?
3. What is the average number of goals per game?

## Advanced Questions
4. Who was the most improved player this season?
5. If the coach wants to win two more games, should they focus on offense or defense?

Notes:
- For advanced questions, I provided context and definitions for "improvement" (e.g., difference in stats between first and last half of the season).
