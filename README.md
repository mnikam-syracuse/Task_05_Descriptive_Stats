# Task 05: Descriptive Statistics and LLM Interaction

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use a small dataset and interact with a Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to answer natural language questions about that dataset. The goal is to test LLM performance on structured data and evaluate its ability to provide accurate insights.

## Objectives
- Perform descriptive statistics on a sample dataset.
- Use LLM to answer questions based on the dataset.
- Validate correctness of responses.
- Document the process, successes, and failures.
- Provide visualizations based on the dataset.

## Visual Output
Here is an example visualization generated from the sample dataset:

## Steps
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset (not included in this repo as per instructions).
2. Compute basic descriptive statistics using Python (Pandas).
3. Design prompts to interact with LLM.
4. Record LLM responses and analyze their accuracy.
5. Summarize findings in `report.md`.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenAI API (or similar for LLM)

## How to Run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python analysis.py
```
